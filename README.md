This is a personal project for getting myself more familiar with Python modules as well as integration 
of LLM models through tools like Ollama.

The module code for interpreting and parsing the docx is rather primitive and heavily relies upon adherence
to existing formatting rules I established in my Word projects, but gets the job done.

For reference, I try to leave exhaustive commit messages where I can.
